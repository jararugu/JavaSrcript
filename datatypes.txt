TypeCasting:
-> is a converting from one datatype to another datatype is called typecasting.
-> there are two type of typecasting
1. Implicit
-> converting from onr datattype to another datatype internally is called implicit typecasting
2. explicit:
-> converting from onr datattype to another datatype Externally using some of methods is callled Explicit typecasting


datatypes:

 there are to types in JS

primitive datatypes:
are object dereferencing and immutable
-> Number
-> BigInt
->Null
-> Undefined
->String
->Boolean

Non -primitive datatypes:
are object referencing and its mutable
-> Arrays
-> Functions
-> Objects

Mutable:
-> means whenver the value is updated the updated value will be altered in the same memory space or same object address.
immutable:
-> means whenever the value is updated instead of altering the value in the same memory space.
->it will craete a new memory space for update value
